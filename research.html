										<h2>In Situ Origins of Hot Jupiters</h2>
										<p>2021-Present</p>

									</div>
									<p>The longest-standing mystery in exoplanets is the origin of hot Jupiters. The conventional theory
										is that these short-period gas giants first form in the outer regions of their respective systems
										before migrating inward to their current orbits. While several variants of this inward migration
										paradigm (e.g., disk migration, high-eccentricity migration) are successful in explaining the observed properties of hot Jupiters (and warm Jupiters),
										none are fully consistent with the full suite of known characteristics.
										Chief among these is the <em>observed isolation</em> of hot Jupiters relative to warm Jupiters,
										wherein hot Jupiters host nearby low-mass planetary companion much less often
										than their longer-period counterparts. The companion rates for these two populations should be similar
										assuming either migration scenario, with quiescent disk migration favoring higher rates
										than high-eccentricity migration.</p>

									<p>Additionally, these migration-based formation scenarios are solely informed by the
										architecture of our own solar system, which we now know to be the exception rather
										than the rule. Instead, thanks to space-based transit and Doppler velocity surveys,
										we find there is a widespread prevalence of close-in "super-Earths"
										, which suggests that the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are more massive than predicted
										from our solar system. These compact planets often exhibit a surprising
										"peas in a pod" structure (Weiss et al. 2018), where they share similar spacing,
										masses, and radii, with typical masses from a few to a few tens of Earth masses and orbital
										periods from a few days to months. If massive enough, these planets may trigger
										run-away accretion <em>in situ</em> to become gas giants in the inner region of the disk before
										the surrounding gas dissipates. Assuming the progenitor systems are more compact
										than observed <em>Kepler</em> multis, an in situ-formed giant should naturally trigger instability
										and subsequent dynamical sculpting once the disk has vanished.</p>

									    <!--<p>Period ratio of giants with respect to their nearest companion as a function of period.</p>-->
									</div>
									
									<p>To this end, I am currently leading a project with collaborators Songhu Wang,
										Bonan Pu, Malena Rice, and Dong-Hong Wu that tests the viability of
										this scenario using N-body simulations. We study and describe
										the dynamical consequences on compact multi-planet host systems which
										contain an in situ-formed short-period gas giant. We find that in situ formation
										naturally reproduces several known properties of hot and warm Jupiters, including
										the companionship dichotomy. This is illustrated in the figure on the right, 
										which shows the period ratios of our simulated Jupiters with their nearest low-mass
										companion after 10 Myr of evolution: the shortest-period giants are typically
										much more isolated than others. We posit that a large fraction of these companions
										to hot Jupiters are too distant and/or exhibit too high of mutual inclinations to be 
										detected efficiently, causing hot Jupiters to appear more lonely than they truly are.
										Our paper (Radzom et al. 2022b) will soon be
										submitted to the ApJ.</p>

										<h2>Parameterization of Stability in Hierarchical Multi-planet Systems</h2>

									<p>Most <em>Kepler</em>-like systems contain more than two planets, with the average
										instrinsic multiplicity predicted to be nearly 6 planets per star (Zink, Christiansen & Hansen 2019)
										. As mentioned above, the majority of these systems appear to have a peas-in-a-pod
										structure with similar period ratios between adjacent pairs and throughout the entire system.
										While there is little analytical understanding of dynamical instability
										in generalized high-multiplicity (N>3) systems, a number of semi-analytic
										and empirical studies exist which focus on the relationship between the spacing
										and stability of uniform systems. These studies are largely comprised of N-body
									simulations of idealized Equal Mutual Separation (EMS) systems, for which the 
									instability timescale is well-parameterized by the spacing parameter K. Broadly, it is seen
										that systems with smaller K values (i.e., smaller period ratios) are more likely
										to undergo instability (and on shorter timescales), which is consistent with the 
										paucity of <em>Kepler</em> planets with period ratios less than 3:2. Wu et al. 2019
										expanded these studies by running N-body simulations of non-EMS peas-in-a-pod systems, 
										finding that the lower limit of the instability timescale is determined by the minimal
										value of the spacing parameter within the system.</p>
									<p>For in situ-formed short-period giants, a phase of post-disk dynamical instability
										may be key to sculpt the architectures we see today. In order to build a deeper 
										understanding of this picture and link progenitor systems to what is currently
										observed, it will be important to characterize the primary 
										drivers of instability in multi-planet systems containing a hot or warm Jupiter.
										Thus, I am using N-body simulations of high-multiplicity, compact, non-EMS progenitor
										systems containing a close-in Jovian-class planet to parameterize instability in hierarchical multis.
									Preliminary results suggest that the harmonic mean of the K values within these types of systems is
									the best indicator of the instability timescale.</p>

										<h2>X-ray Sources in the SSA22 Field</h2>

									<p>Supermassive black holes lie at the center of most galaxies, and many actively accrete
										matter to become Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Due to the presence of surrounding 
									gas, optical campaigns to detect AGNs are biased to unobscured, or broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs).
										Observations in the X-ray (2-8 keV) with <em>Chandra</em>'s ACIS instrument can
										rectify this and 
									provide an unbiased probe of these objects, thanks to the high column density-penetrating
									nature of hard X-rays. Combined with tools like the luminosity function, astronomers
										have learned that AGNs are a strongly evolving population that have been active
										much more recently in cosmic history than was previously thought. Further, obscured
									or non-BLAGNs tend to make up the faint end of the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) while BLAGNs
									dominate the bright end at higher redshift.</p>
									<p>The focus of my undergraduate astronomy research was investigating the differential
										evolution of these two AGN types with newly obtained high-resolution spectroscopy from the
										Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on Keck. I led a project with collaborators Anthony
										J. Taylor and Dr. Amy Barger to combine these
									spectra with existing X-ray and optical photometry in the Hawaii Survey Field SSA22, which is one
										of the deepest and most well-studied <em>Chandra</em> fields (thanks to the famous
										protocluster at z=3.09). In total, we bring the completeness of the field to 62% by updating
										spectroscopic redshifts for nearly half of the available X-ray sources, and derive
										optical classifications for most from our data (these are roughly encoded in the
										luminosity distribution on the left).</p>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/final_ssa22_lum_z_dist_classes.jpg" width="404" height="331" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>After applying an incompleteness
									correction and computing photometric redshifts for objects without redshifts, we constructed the XLF 
										in three redshift intervals for ~160 AGN candidates in the field
									across z=0-4 (see figure below). We found good agreement with previous works, with the XLF shifting the higher
									X-ray luminosity with increasing redshift. Additionally, we remove all candidate members of the z=3.09 galactic protocluster
										and reconstruct the XLF to demonstrate that this overdensity did not significantly affect our result.
										We also use our classifications to study the XLF
									for BLAGNs and non-BLAGNs separately, which reveals that the unobscured BLAGNs become increasingly
										important at higher redshift, peaking in number density near z=2. As a consequence of this,
									the faint-end slope of our AGN XLF flattens with redshift. While we find that both BLAGNs and
									non-BLAGNs evolve in luminosity and density with increasing redshift, non-BLAGNs exhibit the strongest
									evolution and peak in number density near z=1. The XLF of these obscured AGNs tend to have a lower break luminosity and higher
									normalization across z=1-4. This work (Radzom et al. 2022a) was submitted to ApJ in September 2022. </p>

										<h2>Polarization Alignment in Birefringent Optical Fibers</h2>

									<p>My first research experience was in Dr. Saffman's lab at UW - Madison, which focused on approaches to quantum computing using
										neutral atoms. The most substantial but rewarding project I worked on was developing a device and an associated procedure
										to align laser beam polarization to the optical fiber axis in birefringent fibers. Single-mode
										fibers are ubiquitous in optics labs (thanks to their ability to reduce system complexity), but are
										subject to a variety of environmental stresses (e.g., bending, heating). These stresses induce unwanted
										drifts in the polarization state of the light traveling through the fiber over time, which renders the large
										optical set-ups needed for quantum experiments useless until realignment is achieved. Birefringent polarization-maintaining
										fibers are able to mitigate these effects and maintain the input linear polarization state
										due to the presence of two orthogonal stress rods with differing refractive indicies internal to the fiber. 
										The difference of these refractive indicies is known as birefringence. How this birefringence can be used
										to maintain polarization alignment is complicated (and fascinating!), but is broadly explained by the fact that
										birefringence induces a well-defined phase delay for the two orthogonal states over the length of the fiber.</p>
									<p>The alignment provided by these birefringent fibers is good but not perfect, and is further complicated by the fact that these fibers
									are often connectorized, featuring a key-hole output at one end. If not carefully executed, the process to attach (usually glue) this key-hole
									onto the fiber can create additional sources of stress which substantially reduce the effectiveness of the birefringent design.
										This misalignment can be corrected for by once again inducing a well-defined
										perturbation onto the fiber. Several methods exist for this purpose, including
										the famous elasto-optic (E-O) method, but many are too complicated or carry too
										high of a potential to damage the fiber to be practical.
									</p>
									<p>In collaboration with Dr. Matthew Ebert, I designed and implemented a novel polarization alignment
										scheme which is safe, systematic, and simple to perform. 
									
										This additional
									source of birefringence can be mitigated by once again in-
									ducing a well-defined stress, or perturbation to the fiber. One
									common but problematic method of producing this strain is
									via the elasto-optic (also known as fiber-squeeze) method,
									originally outlined in Carrara, Kim & Shaw (1986)2. Yet this
									method requires precise engineering and substantial prepara-
									tion to create a stress that will not damage the fiber. Further,
									the stress induced on a fiber by such a device is relatively dif-
									ficult to characterize, potentially limiting the ability of this
									procedure to be systematic.
									In this paper, we describe a safe, systematic, and straight-
									forward methodology to align the input polarization to the
									fiber. Using a polarimeter and a frequency scan, we create a
									controllable signal that is proportional to the polarization mis-
									alignment. T
									The polarization angle of the incident light, theta ( f ) can be
									determined from the polarimeter signal as shown above. The
									fiber output polarization angle is dependent on the frequency
									of the light, f due to the birefringence of the PM fiber. Pre-
									cise polarization alignment is then possible by ramping the
									frequency of the input laser (which will cause periodic spikes
									in deltaP) and then decoupling the power from the frequency.
									This is practically done by iteratively adjusting the input and
									output polarization until the normalized differential signal ∆P
									is flat (as it was before the frequency ramping), and the sum
									Px + Py is maximal. Since deltaP is proportional to the polariza-
									tion misalignment, we have therefore ensured that the polar-
									ization is maintained at the output of the fiber (regardless of
									the frequency), while retaining optimal transmission power</p>
