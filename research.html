										<h2>Dynamical Origins of Short-Period Giants</h2>

									<p>Since the discovery of 51 Pegasi b in 1995, exoplanet scientists have been
									puzzled by the existence of gas giants on close-in orbits known as hot Jupiters.
									Various observational properties can be used to constrain their origins, such as
									their system architectures, and eccentricity and stellar obliquity distributions.
									Dedicated observational campagins over the past two decades have revealed that
									hot Jupiters are often isolated, lacking nearby planetary companions, and have large
									eccentricities and spin-orbit misalignments consistent with high-eccentricity migration
										triggered by <u>violent dynamical evolution</u>. However, a growing sample of hot Jupiters have
										 been discovered to host nearby companions on low-mutual inclination and aligned orbits, suggesting
										that they have arrived at their current orbits via more <u>quiescent mechanisms</u> such as migration
										through the protoplanetary disk or perhaps in situ formation.</p> 
									

									 <p>Curiously, the population of wider-orbiting counterparts to hot Jupiters, known as warm Jupiters, appear
										 to have properties consistent with quiescent origins, and their somewhat less massive counterparts, known as hot sub-Saturns,
										may have properties intermediate to hot and warm Jupiters.
										 In this context, <em>my PhD dissertation research aims to investigate the origins of short-period
										 giant planets</em> through a combination of observational and numerical studies, which are detailed below.

									<p>Stellar obliquity, or the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbit normal axis of its planet(s), is a unqiue
									and informative indicator of a system's dynamical history. Despite decades of effort, it remains unclear whether
									the primary mechanism driving spin-orbit misalignment is a universal process that takes place during formation
										with the protoplanetary
									disk present or an evolution-specific process that occurs in post-disk phase, perhaps due to the violent dynamics inherent
									to high-eccentricty migration. In the latter case, misalignment may largely be confined hot Jupiters and hot Saturns.
										
										
										Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate
									between these competing hypotheses, as their
									tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing
									them to trace the primordial disk plane.</p>
										
									<p>The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (Holt 1893, Rossiter 1924, McLaughlin 1924), which 
									takes advantage of the time-resolved spectral distortion from an actively transiting or eclipsing body,
										presents a reliable method
									to determine a system's projected spin-orbit angle. With additional information on the stellar inclination, 
									the true 3D stellar obliquity can be derived as well.</p>

									<br>
									<p>TOI-5143 c is a hot Jupiter in a compact multi-planet system recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
										mission and confirmed by Quinn et al., in prep., and is only the <em>third</em> of such systems to have its stellar obliquity
										measured. In my recent analysis of this system, we employ Bayesian Inference and the Doppler Shadow
									technique to measure its stellar obliquity via the RM effect, finding it is well-aligned. Our result continues the trend of alignemnt 
										seen in previous
									spin-orbit measurements for other hot Jupiters with nearby companions (e.g., WASP-47 b and WASP-84 b), as well as the current census of RM measurements
									for compact multi-planet systems. This reinforces the hypothesis that planetary systems are largely primordially aligned,
										with misalignments being acquired in the post-disk phase due to dynamical evolution. Further, our measurement
									demonstrates that some hot Jupiters <em>must</em> have quiescent origins, having avoided achieving the large eccentricities
									that would have otherwise destroyed their companions and/or excited their obliquities during their path to their close-in orbits.</p>

									</div>
									<br>
									<p>Sub-Saturns, with masses intermediate of Neptune and Jupiter, represent an interesting population to study both the origins
										of giant planets and the mechanisms driving misalignment. Using the radial velocity anomaly of the RM effect, we measured the stellar obliquity
										 for two close-in sub-Saturns in compact multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126 b
									 and TOI-5398 b. Both are spin-orbit aligned,
										joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment.
										Our obliquity measurements allow the first statistical analyses to be run on the stellar obliquities of close-in sub-Saturns, and
										we perform a random shuffling procedure to verify that the preferential alignment of compact sub-Saturns is statistically significant (to 2.6σ).
										Our results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned
										and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.

										<h3>N-body Simulations of Short-Period Giants in Compact Multi-planet Systems</h3>

									</div>
										In light of recent companion searches that have revealed a number of hot Jupiters with nearby planetary companions
										(e.g., WASP-47 b; Becker et al. 2015, Kepler-730 b; Canas et al. 2019, TOI-1130 c;
										Huang et al. 2020, WASP-148 b; Hebrard et al. 2020, TOI-2494 b, TOI-5143 c; Quinn et al., in prep.,
									WASP-132 b; Hord et al. 2022) and TTV signal searches (Wu et al. 2023), it is plausible that hot Jupiters
										in compact configurations are more common than we thought.</p>
									
									
									<p>I use N-body simulations to test the viability of quiescent formation pathways to produce hot Jupiters,
										such as disk migration and in situ formation, from a purely dynamical perspective
										using N-body simulations. Specifically,	I find that quiescent formation pathways for such giants
										may naturally produce the hot Jupiter-warm Juptier companionship dichotomy, 
										as hot Jupiters dynamically self-isolate relative to warm Jupiters. The figures on the right
										show that companions of hot Jupiters achieve
										significantly larger period ratios and mutual inclinations than those of warm Jupiters, and are 
										generally more difficult to detect via transits, transit timing variations, and radial velocities.
									This dichotomy is a consequence of more efficient communication of large eccentricities
										in hot Jupiter systems, which maximizes the diversity of dynamical outcomes for planetary companions
										system-wide. Critically, this work demonstrates that the observed preferential isolation of hot Jupiters
									is not a feature that is unique to violent high-eccentricity migration, providing important context for observations.</p>

										</div>
									<p>
										Additionally, I find that this paradigm can also explain the peculiar architectures of 
										some short-period giants with nearby companions. This includes the existence of a population
										of ultra-short-period (USP) companions to both hot and warm Jupiters, as well as the 
										propensity for the nearby companions of hot Jupiters to reside on interior orbits.
										While such a model may generally overpredict the companion multiplicity in such systems,
										its prevalence can be readily assessed by future high-precision
										RV searches for small, mutually inclined outer companions to hot Jupiters - which are a generic
										outcome of these simulations. </p>

										<h3>Parameterization of Stability in Hierarchical Multi-planet Systems</h3>
										<p>2021</p>

									<p>Most <em>Kepler</em>-like systems contain more than two planets, with the average
										instrinsic multiplicity predicted to be nearly 6 planets per star (Zink, Christiansen & Hansen 2019)
										. As mentioned above, the majority of these systems appear to have a peas-in-a-pod
										structure with similar period ratios between adjacent pairs and throughout the entire system.
										While there is little analytical understanding of dynamical instability
										in generalized high-multiplicity (N>3) systems, a number of semi-analytic
										and empirical studies exist which focus on the relationship between the spacing
										and stability of uniform systems. These studies are largely comprised of N-body
									simulations of idealized Equal Mutual Separation (EMS) systems, for which the 
									instability timescale is well-parameterized by the spacing parameter K. Broadly, it is seen
										that systems with smaller K values (i.e., smaller period ratios) are more likely
										to undergo instability (and on shorter timescales), which is consistent with the 
										paucity of <em>Kepler</em> planets with period ratios less than 3:2. Wu et al. 2019
										expanded these studies by running N-body simulations of non-EMS peas-in-a-pod systems, 
										finding that the lower limit of the instability timescale is determined by the minimal
										value of the spacing parameter within the system.</p>
									<p>For in situ-formed short-period giants, a phase of post-disk dynamical instability
										may be key to sculpt the architectures we see today. In order to build a deeper 
										understanding of this picture and link progenitor systems to what is currently
										observed, it will be important to characterize the primary 
										drivers of instability in multi-planet systems containing a hot or warm Jupiter.
										Thus, I am using N-body simulations of high-multiplicity, compact, non-EMS progenitor
										systems containing a close-in Jovian-class planet to parameterize instability in hierarchical multis.
									Preliminary results suggest that the harmonic mean of the K values within these types of systems is
									the best indicator of the instability timescale.</p>

									<p>Supermassive black holes lie at the center of most galaxies, and many actively accrete
										matter to become Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Due to the presence of surrounding 
									gas, optical campaigns to detect AGNs are biased to unobscured, or broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs).
										Observations in the X-ray (2-8 keV) with <em>Chandra</em>'s ACIS instrument can
										rectify this and 
									provide an unbiased probe of these objects, thanks to the high column density-penetrating
									nature of hard X-rays. Combined with tools like the luminosity function, astronomers
										have learned that AGNs are a strongly evolving population that have been active
										much more recently in cosmic history than was previously thought. Further, obscured
									or non-BLAGNs tend to make up the faint end of the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) while BLAGNs
									dominate the bright end at higher redshift.</p>
									<p>The focus of my undergraduate astronomy research was investigating the differential
										evolution of these two AGN types with newly obtained high-resolution spectroscopy from the
										Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on Keck. I led a project with collaborators Anthony
										J. Taylor and Dr. Amy Barger to combine these
									spectra with existing X-ray and optical photometry in the Hawaii Survey Field SSA22, which is one
										of the deepest and most well-studied <em>Chandra</em> fields (thanks to the famous
										protocluster at z=3.09). In total, we bring the completeness of the field to 62% by updating
										spectroscopic redshifts for nearly half of the available X-ray sources, and derive
										optical classifications for most from our data (these are roughly encoded in the
										luminosity distribution on the left).</p>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/final_ssa22_lum_z_dist_classes.jpg" width="404" height="331" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>After applying an incompleteness
									correction and computing photometric redshifts for objects without redshifts, we constructed the XLF 
										in three redshift intervals for ~160 AGN candidates in the field
									across z=0-4 (see figure below). We found good agreement with previous works, with the XLF shifting the higher
									X-ray luminosity with increasing redshift. Additionally, we remove all candidate members of the z=3.09 galactic protocluster
										and reconstruct the XLF to demonstrate that this overdensity did not significantly affect our result.
										We also use our classifications to study the XLF
									for BLAGNs and non-BLAGNs separately, which reveals that the unobscured BLAGNs become increasingly
										important at higher redshift, peaking in number density near z=2. As a consequence of this,
									the faint-end slope of our AGN XLF flattens with redshift. While we find that both BLAGNs and
									non-BLAGNs evolve in luminosity and density with increasing redshift, non-BLAGNs exhibit the strongest
									evolution and peak in number density near z=1. The XLF of these obscured AGNs tend to have a lower break luminosity and higher
									normalization across z=1-4. This work (Radzom et al. 2022) was published in ApJ in November 2022 (doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ac9bfe). </p>

										<h2>Polarization Alignment in Birefringent Optical Fibers</h2>
										<p>2018-2020</p>

									</div>
									<p>My first research experience was in Dr. Saffman's lab at UW - Madison, which focused on approaches to quantum computing using
										neutral atoms. The most substantial but rewarding project I worked on was developing a device and an associated procedure
										to align laser beam polarization to the optical fiber axis in birefringent fibers. Single-mode
										fibers are ubiquitous in optics labs (thanks to their ability to reduce system complexity), but are
										subject to a variety of environmental stresses (e.g., bending, heating). These stresses induce unwanted
										drifts in the polarization state of the light traveling through the fiber over time. Such misalignment renders the large
										optical set-ups needed for neutral atom quantum experiments useless until realignment is achieved, as polarization is a
										fundamental parameter in quantum logic. Birefringent polarization-maintaining (PM)
										fibers are able to mitigate these effects and maintain the input linear polarization state
										due to the presence of two orthogonal stress rods with differing refractive indicies internal to the fiber. 
										The difference of these refractive indicies is known as birefringence. How this birefringence can be used
										to maintain polarization alignment is complicated (and fascinating!), but is broadly explained by the fact that
										birefringence induces a well-defined phase delay for the two orthogonal states over the length of the fiber.</p>
									<p>The alignment provided by these birefringent fibers is good but not perfect, and is further complicated by the fact that these fibers
									are often connectorized, featuring a key-hole output at one end. If not carefully executed, the process to attach (usually glue) this key-hole
									onto the fiber can create additional sources of stress which substantially reduce the effectiveness of the birefringent design.
										This misalignment can be corrected for by once again inducing a well-defined
										perturbation onto the fiber. Several methods exist for this purpose, including
										the famous elasto-optic (E-O) method, but many are too complicated or carry too
										high of a potential to damage the fiber to be practical.
									</p>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/optical_setup.PNG" width="524" height="320" align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>In collaboration with Dr. Matthew Ebert, Dr. Trent Graham, and Dr. Mark Saffman,
										I designed and implemented a novel polarization alignment
										scheme which is safe, systematic, and simple to perform. Briefly, we fabricate
										a controllable signal that is 
										proportional to the polarization misalignment and we manipulate
										the light using a polarimeter until alignment is achieved.
										More specifically, we attach the fiber to a polarimeter
										that outputs a real-time 'differential signal' which is proportional
										to the difference in the power between the two orthogonal polarization modes
										(but normalized to the total power).
										This voltage signal yields the polarization angle
										of the light incident to the fiber (via a cosine relation). Since the output
										angle is dependent on the 
										input laser's frequency (due to the fiber's birefringence), it
										becomes possible to decouple the power from the frequency using a frequency ramping procedure.
										This is because once the frequency scan begins, a periodic 'spike'-like signal is output
										by the polarimeter.
										One can flatten this signal via iterative adjustment of the input
										and output polarization (using the polarimeter) while also ensuring that the
										sum of the power in each polarization mode is maximal. A flat signal indicates that the power difference
										between both modes is no
										longer frequency-dependent (i.e., the polarization state is decoupled fro the frequency).
										Polarization alignment is guarenteed to be maintained throughout the fiber in this case
										since it is directly proportional to the now-flattened differential signal, while
										maximal transmission is retained. I built 
										the polarimeter using laboratory optics and custom-machined parts, but
										any polarimeter which separates the orthogonal components of linearly polarized  
										light will work for this procedure (see Figures to the left).</p>
										
										<p>As one can see, the perturbation required for our alignment
									procedure is simply a frequency scan, which presents no real stress on the fiber.
									Additionally, the method is repeatable and easy to perform as the frequency ramping
									is over some well-defined range and all of the necessary optical components are 
									readily present in most laboratories. We also found that introducing a quarter waveplate
									(QWP) greatly reduced the polarization drift over time, which we quantified by running a 
									series of experiments. A schematic of our optical set-up prior to feeding the light into
											the polarimeter is shown on the right.
									</p>
										
									<div>
									    <img src="images/combinedOZ_var_drift.png" width="400" height="500" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>

									<p>In order test the alignment stability and sensitivity associated with
										this method, we induce an external thermal stress on an OZ Optics
										PM fiber and measure the resultant polarization drift. Particularly, we
									used a make-shift oven to heat the PM fiber roughly 5<span>&#176;</span>C over 15 minutes
									and we measure the mean and the variance of the alignment drift during the experiment. 
									We repeat this for several angular offsets from nominal alignment (±0.25,±0.5,±1, and ±2 degrees)
										to show that
									the drift is minimized when our frequency-ramping procedure is carried out. We find
									that our procedure is capable of aligning the polarization axes to within 0.5
									degrees without the QWP included along the beam path and 0.25 degrees with it.
										In addition to these experiments, we also ran test to show that:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>	(1) OZ Optics PM fibers maintain polarization better than equivalent Thorlabs fibers</li>
										<li>	(2) the E-O method is not as effective for a given fiber</li>
										<li>	(3) longer fibers (up to 10 meters) show lower overall drift</li>
										<li>	(4) higher beam coupling (>50%) minimizes drift</li>
										<li>	(5) equivalent results are obtained regardless of the alignment axis (i.e., slow or fast) </li>
									</ol>
									
									<p>The primary "best-case" results of this project are represented in the figure on the left,
										which displays the mean drift and variance as a function of offset angle for the
										10-meter OZ PM fiber experiments both with (blue x) and without (blue sqaures) the QWP. 
									These results are currently drafted in a manuscript which may be submitted to the Review of Scientific
									Instruments journal, and the full procedure is written up on our lab's <a href="https://wiki.physics.wisc.edu/saffmanwiki/FrontPage">wiki page</a>.</p>

									<p>The first-ever research project I worked on was also in Dr. Saffman's lab
										at UW - Madison, but was dedicated to a specific experiment. Particularly,
										I designed and implemented a high-precision temperature control system
										for our new Rubidium atomic trapping chamber. But first, what is an atomic trapping
										chamber and why is temperature regulation important? In order to build a quantum computer
										using neutral atoms, ensembles of neutral atoms must be encoded and trapped (via laser cooling)
										in
										special excited states known as W-sates. Maintaining this array of neutral atom quantum bits or qubits
										results in an optical lattice that can serve as the basis for a quantum computer. 
										If reliably trapped, one can perform quantum logic operations by
										exciting the atoms to a high-lying (n~100) so-called Rydberg state where they
										can undergo coherent interactions. However, great care must be taken to mitigate
										the rate of logical errors (i.e., incorrect atomic states) for this trap to hold.
										Theoretically, the potential fidelity (error rate) 
										for two-qubit entanglement via Rydberg interactions exceeds >0.9999, but previous
										attempts by any laboratory
										have only reached 0.8. Maximizing the fidelity of the initial W-state preparation
										is possible by either reducing system noise, minimizing polarization crosstalk 
										(i.e., polarization drift, see above project), or otherwise
									improving the stability of atomic cooling in the trap.</p>
									<p>My work for this project addressed the first of these points, for which I
										was charged with creating a temperature regulation system for our group's newest
										atomic trap. The environmental perturbations caused by large temperature fluctuations
										(>1<span>&#176;</span>C)
										throughout the previous fiberoptic system essentially made our
										optically trapped
										atoms moving targets. Therefore, I first developed a see-through prototype of a
										temperature-stable chamber which involved three ultra low-noise water-cooled fans
										(seen in the picture on the top right). Proof-of-concept tests with this prototype
										showed promise, so I drafted a full plan for a negative feedback PID temperature loop.
									I ordered the appropriate electronics (PID controller, fuses, heat sink, temperature probes, etc.) and machined an
									electronics box I designed on SolidWorks. After careful assembly, I ran another set of preliminary
									tests with the system to optimize the set-up, and integrated real-time temperature readout and control
									via lab computers. Finally, I installed the temperature regulation system into the new
									atomic chamber. The system is capable of consistently maintaining ~mK-level stability 
									within the chamber, far exceeding initial requirements and expectations and representing
									an improvement of over two orders of mangitude relative to the previous ambient trap. The
									lab still uses this system to this day for Rubidium experiments.</p>
