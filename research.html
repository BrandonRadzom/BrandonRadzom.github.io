									<p>Hot Jupiters, the shortest-period class of gas giants, are conventionally thought
									to form through dynamically violent processes such as high-eccentricity migration.
									Some of the most commonly referenced pieces of observational evidence for this are:
										<ul>
											<li>The near-zero rate of nearby planetary companions to hot Jupiters 
												(see Steffen et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2016)</li>
											<li>The presence of large misalignments in the stellar obliquity distribution of hot Jupiters 
												(see Schlaufman et al. 2010, Winn et al. 2010, Albrecht et al. 2012)</li>
										</ul>  
									</p>

									 <p>However, the somewhat wider-orbiting counterparts to hot Jupiters, known as warm Jupiters, may
										 not share these properties, while their somewhat less massive counterparts, known as sub-Saturns,
										 may have a nearby companion rate similar to warm Jupiters but an obliquity distribution more similar 
										 to hot Jupiters. My PhD dissertation research at IU aims to disentangle the origins of these short-period
										 giant planets via a combination of observational and numerical studies, which are detailed below.

										<h3>Stellar Obliquity Measurements Via The Rossiter-McLaughlin Effect</h3>
									</header>
									<p>Stellar obliquity, or the angle between the stellar spin axis and the orbit normal axis of its planet(s), is a unqiue
									and informative indicator of a system's dynamical history. Despite decades of effort, it remains unclear whether spin-orbit
									misalignment takes place during formation, with the protoplanetary disk present, or post-formation following 
									the disappearence of the disk.</p>
										
									<p>The Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect (Holt 1893, Rossiter 1924, McLaughlin 1924), which 
									takes advantage of the time-resolved spectral effects of an actively transiting or eclipsing body, presents a reliable method
									to determine a system's projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$. With additional information on the stellar inclination, 
									the true 3D stellar obliquity $\psi$ can be derived as well.</p>

										<h4>TOI-5143 (Radzom et al. 2024b, in prep.)</h4>
									</header>
									<p>TOI-5143 is a hot Jupiter in a compact multi-planet system recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS)
										mission, and is only the <em>third</em> of such systems to have its stellar obliquity measured. We use the Doppler Shadow
									method of the RM effect to measure its stellar obliquity, finding it is well-aligned. Our result continues the trend of alignemnt 
										seen in previous
									spin-orbit measurements for other hot Jupiters with nearby companions (e.g., WASP-47 and WASP-84), as well as the current census of RM measurements
									for compact multi-planet systems. This reinforces the hypothesis that planetary systems are largely primordially aligned,
										with misalignments being acquired in the post-disk phase due to dynamical evolution. Further, our measurement
									demonstrates that some hot Jupiters <em>must</em> have quiescent origins, having avoided achieving the large eccentricities
									that would have otherwise destroyed their companions and/or excited their obliquities during their path to their close-in orbits.</p>

									<p>Sub-Saturns, with masses intermediate of Neptune and Jupiter, represent an interesting population to study both the origins
										of giant planets and the mechanisms by which the orbital axes of planets become misaligned with the stellar spin axes.
										Despite decades of effort, the mechanisms by which the spin axis of a star and the orbital axes of its planets become
										misaligned remain elusive. Particularly, it is of great interest whether the large spin-orbit misalignments observed
										are driven primarily by high-eccentricity migration --- expected to have occurred for short-period, isolated planets
										--- or reflect a more universal process that operates across systems with a variety of present-day architectures.
										Compact multi-planet systems offer a unique opportunity to differentiate between these competing hypotheses, as their
										tightly-packed configurations preclude violent dynamical histories, including high-eccentricity migration, allowing
										them to trace the primordial disk plane. In this context, we report measurements of the sky-projected stellar obliquity
										($\lambda$) via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for two sub-Saturns in multiple-transiting systems: TOI-5126\,b
										($\lambda=1\pm 48 \degree$) and TOI-5398\,b ($\lambda=-24^{+14}_{-13} \degree$). Both are spin-orbit aligned,
										joining a fast-growing group of just three other compact sub-Saturn systems, all of which exhibit spin-orbit alignment.
										{\bf In aggregate with archival data, our} results strongly suggest that sub-Saturn systems are primordially aligned
										and become misaligned largely in the post-disk phase, as appears to be the case increasingly for other exoplanet populations.

										<h2>N-body Simulations of Short-Period Giant Systems</h2>
										<p>2021-2023</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>The longest-standing mystery in the field of exoplanets is the origin of short-period gas giants, as the first exoplanet
										discovered around a Sun-like star was a hot Jupiter, 51 Pegasi b.
										Hot Jupiters, the shortest-period gas giants, have conventionally been thought
										to form only through dynamically violent processes such as high-eccentricity migration.
										One of the most commonly referenced pieces of evidence for this is the
										<em>observed isolation</em> of hot Jupiters, wherein these giants rarely host nearby planetary companions.
										Such companions would have been cleared out during the violent migration process, 
										while giants undergoing less dramatic inward migration, such as warm Jupiters, may
										more readily retain their nearby companions (see eccentric migration paradigm proposed by 
										Wu et al. 2023).
										. Indeed, there is strong evidence for a dichotomy in the nearby companion rates, with warm Jupiters
									often being found in compact multi-planet systems (e.g., Huang et al. 2016).
									
									
									On the other hand, the wider-orbiting warm Jupiters are commonly found in compact multiple-planet
											systems (Huang et al. 2016). This suggests that these giants have origins that are either completely independent of
											hot Jupiters, or diverge during the dynamical evolutionary stages that take place after the
											dissipation of the disk. In the latter scenario, giant planets may achieve a wide range of eccentricity
											excitation in the post-disk phase, resulting in a spectrum of short orbital periods, eccentricities, stellar obliquities, and 
											companion retention (see the eccentric migration paradigm described in Wu et al. 2023).</p>

									<p>Additionally, these migration-based formation scenarios are solely informed by the
										architecture of our own solar system, which we now know to be the exception rather
										than the rule. Instead, thanks to space-based transit and Doppler velocity surveys,
										we find there is a widespread prevalence of close-in "super-Earths"
										, which suggests that the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are more massive than predicted
										from our solar system. These compact planets often exhibit a surprising
										"peas in a pod" structure (Weiss et al. 2018), where they share similar spacing,
										masses, and radii, with typical masses from a few to a few tens of Earth masses and orbital
										periods from a few days to months. If massive enough, these planets may trigger
										run-away accretion <em>in situ</em> to become gas giants in the inner region of the disk before
										the surrounding gas dissipates. Assuming the progenitor systems are more compact
										than observed <em>Kepler</em> multis, an in situ-formed giant should naturally trigger instability
										and subsequent dynamical sculpting once the disk has vanished.</p>

									    <!--<p>Period ratio of giants with respect to their nearest companion as a function of period.</p>-->
									</div>
									
									<p>To this end, I am currently leading a project with collaborators Songhu Wang,
										Bonan Pu, Malena Rice, and Dong-Hong Wu that tests the viability of
										this scenario using N-body simulations. We study and describe
										the dynamical consequences on compact multi-planet host systems which
										contain an in situ-formed short-period gas giant. We find that in situ formation
										naturally reproduces several known properties of hot and warm Jupiters, including
										the companionship dichotomy. This is illustrated in the figure on the right, 
										which shows the period ratios of our simulated Jupiters with their nearest low-mass
										companion after 10 Myr of evolution: the shortest-period giants are typically
										much more isolated than others. We posit that a large fraction of these companions
										to hot Jupiters are too distant and/or exhibit too high of mutual inclinations to be 
										detected efficiently, causing hot Jupiters to appear more lonely than they truly are.
										Our paper (Radzom et al. 2023) will soon be submitted to the ApJ.</p>

										<h3>Parameterization of Stability in Hierarchical Multi-planet Systems</h3>
										<p>2021</p>
									</header>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/orbitsnap_stability.png" width="400" height="400" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>Most <em>Kepler</em>-like systems contain more than two planets, with the average
										instrinsic multiplicity predicted to be nearly 6 planets per star (Zink, Christiansen & Hansen 2019)
										. As mentioned above, the majority of these systems appear to have a peas-in-a-pod
										structure with similar period ratios between adjacent pairs and throughout the entire system.
										While there is little analytical understanding of dynamical instability
										in generalized high-multiplicity (N>3) systems, a number of semi-analytic
										and empirical studies exist which focus on the relationship between the spacing
										and stability of uniform systems. These studies are largely comprised of N-body
									simulations of idealized Equal Mutual Separation (EMS) systems, for which the 
									instability timescale is well-parameterized by the spacing parameter K. Broadly, it is seen
										that systems with smaller K values (i.e., smaller period ratios) are more likely
										to undergo instability (and on shorter timescales), which is consistent with the 
										paucity of <em>Kepler</em> planets with period ratios less than 3:2. Wu et al. 2019
										expanded these studies by running N-body simulations of non-EMS peas-in-a-pod systems, 
										finding that the lower limit of the instability timescale is determined by the minimal
										value of the spacing parameter within the system.</p>
									<p>For in situ-formed short-period giants, a phase of post-disk dynamical instability
										may be key to sculpt the architectures we see today. In order to build a deeper 
										understanding of this picture and link progenitor systems to what is currently
										observed, it will be important to characterize the primary 
										drivers of instability in multi-planet systems containing a hot or warm Jupiter.
										Thus, I am using N-body simulations of high-multiplicity, compact, non-EMS progenitor
										systems containing a close-in Jovian-class planet to parameterize instability in hierarchical multis.
									Preliminary results suggest that the harmonic mean of the K values within these types of systems is
									the best indicator of the instability timescale.</p>

										<h2>X-ray Sources in the SSA22 Field</h2>

									<p>Supermassive black holes lie at the center of most galaxies, and many actively accrete
										matter to become Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). Due to the presence of surrounding 
									gas, optical campaigns to detect AGNs are biased to unobscured, or broad-line AGNs (BLAGNs).
										Observations in the X-ray (2-8 keV) with <em>Chandra</em>'s ACIS instrument can
										rectify this and 
									provide an unbiased probe of these objects, thanks to the high column density-penetrating
									nature of hard X-rays. Combined with tools like the luminosity function, astronomers
										have learned that AGNs are a strongly evolving population that have been active
										much more recently in cosmic history than was previously thought. Further, obscured
									or non-BLAGNs tend to make up the faint end of the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) while BLAGNs
									dominate the bright end at higher redshift.</p>
									<p>The focus of my undergraduate astronomy research was investigating the differential
										evolution of these two AGN types with newly obtained high-resolution spectroscopy from the
										Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph on Keck. I led a project with collaborators Anthony
										J. Taylor and Dr. Amy Barger to combine these
									spectra with existing X-ray and optical photometry in the Hawaii Survey Field SSA22, which is one
										of the deepest and most well-studied <em>Chandra</em> fields (thanks to the famous
										protocluster at z=3.09). In total, we bring the completeness of the field to 62% by updating
										spectroscopic redshifts for nearly half of the available X-ray sources, and derive
										optical classifications for most from our data (these are roughly encoded in the
										luminosity distribution on the left).</p>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/final_ssa22_lum_z_dist_classes.jpg" width="404" height="331" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>After applying an incompleteness
									correction and computing photometric redshifts for objects without redshifts, we constructed the XLF 
										in three redshift intervals for ~160 AGN candidates in the field
									across z=0-4 (see figure below). We found good agreement with previous works, with the XLF shifting the higher
									X-ray luminosity with increasing redshift. Additionally, we remove all candidate members of the z=3.09 galactic protocluster
										and reconstruct the XLF to demonstrate that this overdensity did not significantly affect our result.
										We also use our classifications to study the XLF
									for BLAGNs and non-BLAGNs separately, which reveals that the unobscured BLAGNs become increasingly
										important at higher redshift, peaking in number density near z=2. As a consequence of this,
									the faint-end slope of our AGN XLF flattens with redshift. While we find that both BLAGNs and
									non-BLAGNs evolve in luminosity and density with increasing redshift, non-BLAGNs exhibit the strongest
									evolution and peak in number density near z=1. The XLF of these obscured AGNs tend to have a lower break luminosity and higher
									normalization across z=1-4. This work (Radzom et al. 2022) was published in ApJ in November 2022 (doi:10.3847/1538-4357/ac9bfe). </p>

										<h2>Polarization Alignment in Birefringent Optical Fibers</h2>
										<p>2018-2020</p>

									</div>
									<p>My first research experience was in Dr. Saffman's lab at UW - Madison, which focused on approaches to quantum computing using
										neutral atoms. The most substantial but rewarding project I worked on was developing a device and an associated procedure
										to align laser beam polarization to the optical fiber axis in birefringent fibers. Single-mode
										fibers are ubiquitous in optics labs (thanks to their ability to reduce system complexity), but are
										subject to a variety of environmental stresses (e.g., bending, heating). These stresses induce unwanted
										drifts in the polarization state of the light traveling through the fiber over time. Such misalignment renders the large
										optical set-ups needed for neutral atom quantum experiments useless until realignment is achieved, as polarization is a
										fundamental parameter in quantum logic. Birefringent polarization-maintaining (PM)
										fibers are able to mitigate these effects and maintain the input linear polarization state
										due to the presence of two orthogonal stress rods with differing refractive indicies internal to the fiber. 
										The difference of these refractive indicies is known as birefringence. How this birefringence can be used
										to maintain polarization alignment is complicated (and fascinating!), but is broadly explained by the fact that
										birefringence induces a well-defined phase delay for the two orthogonal states over the length of the fiber.</p>
									<p>The alignment provided by these birefringent fibers is good but not perfect, and is further complicated by the fact that these fibers
									are often connectorized, featuring a key-hole output at one end. If not carefully executed, the process to attach (usually glue) this key-hole
									onto the fiber can create additional sources of stress which substantially reduce the effectiveness of the birefringent design.
										This misalignment can be corrected for by once again inducing a well-defined
										perturbation onto the fiber. Several methods exist for this purpose, including
										the famous elasto-optic (E-O) method, but many are too complicated or carry too
										high of a potential to damage the fiber to be practical.
									</p>
									<div>
									    <img src="images/optical_setup.PNG" width="524" height="320" align="right" style="margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;" alt="" />
									</div>
									<p>In collaboration with Dr. Matthew Ebert, Dr. Trent Graham, and Dr. Mark Saffman,
										I designed and implemented a novel polarization alignment
										scheme which is safe, systematic, and simple to perform. Briefly, we fabricate
										a controllable signal that is 
										proportional to the polarization misalignment and we manipulate
										the light using a polarimeter until alignment is achieved.
										More specifically, we attach the fiber to a polarimeter
										that outputs a real-time 'differential signal' which is proportional
										to the difference in the power between the two orthogonal polarization modes
										(but normalized to the total power).
										This voltage signal yields the polarization angle
										of the light incident to the fiber (via a cosine relation). Since the output
										angle is dependent on the 
										input laser's frequency (due to the fiber's birefringence), it
										becomes possible to decouple the power from the frequency using a frequency ramping procedure.
										This is because once the frequency scan begins, a periodic 'spike'-like signal is output
										by the polarimeter.
										One can flatten this signal via iterative adjustment of the input
										and output polarization (using the polarimeter) while also ensuring that the
										sum of the power in each polarization mode is maximal. A flat signal indicates that the power difference
										between both modes is no
										longer frequency-dependent (i.e., the polarization state is decoupled fro the frequency).
										Polarization alignment is guarenteed to be maintained throughout the fiber in this case
										since it is directly proportional to the now-flattened differential signal, while
										maximal transmission is retained. I built 
										the polarimeter using laboratory optics and custom-machined parts, but
										any polarimeter which separates the orthogonal components of linearly polarized  
										light will work for this procedure (see Figures to the left).</p>
										
										<p>As one can see, the perturbation required for our alignment
									procedure is simply a frequency scan, which presents no real stress on the fiber.
									Additionally, the method is repeatable and easy to perform as the frequency ramping
									is over some well-defined range and all of the necessary optical components are 
									readily present in most laboratories. We also found that introducing a quarter waveplate
									(QWP) greatly reduced the polarization drift over time, which we quantified by running a 
									series of experiments. A schematic of our optical set-up prior to feeding the light into
											the polarimeter is shown on the right.
									</p>
										
									<div>
									    <img src="images/combinedOZ_var_drift.png" width="400" height="500" align="left" style="margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;" alt="" />
									</div>

									<p>In order test the alignment stability and sensitivity associated with
										this method, we induce an external thermal stress on an OZ Optics
										PM fiber and measure the resultant polarization drift. Particularly, we
									used a make-shift oven to heat the PM fiber roughly 5<span>&#176;</span>C over 15 minutes
									and we measure the mean and the variance of the alignment drift during the experiment. 
									We repeat this for several angular offsets from nominal alignment (±0.25,±0.5,±1, and ±2 degrees)
										to show that
									the drift is minimized when our frequency-ramping procedure is carried out. We find
									that our procedure is capable of aligning the polarization axes to within 0.5
									degrees without the QWP included along the beam path and 0.25 degrees with it.
										In addition to these experiments, we also ran test to show that:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>	(1) OZ Optics PM fibers maintain polarization better than equivalent Thorlabs fibers</li>
										<li>	(2) the E-O method is not as effective for a given fiber</li>
										<li>	(3) longer fibers (up to 10 meters) show lower overall drift</li>
										<li>	(4) higher beam coupling (>50%) minimizes drift</li>
										<li>	(5) equivalent results are obtained regardless of the alignment axis (i.e., slow or fast) </li>
									</ol>
									
									<p>The primary "best-case" results of this project are represented in the figure on the left,
										which displays the mean drift and variance as a function of offset angle for the
										10-meter OZ PM fiber experiments both with (blue x) and without (blue sqaures) the QWP. 
									These results are currently drafted in a manuscript which may be submitted to the Review of Scientific
									Instruments journal, and the full procedure is written up on our lab's <a href="https://wiki.physics.wisc.edu/saffmanwiki/FrontPage">wiki page</a>.</p>

										<h2>Temperature Regulation System for an Atomic Trapping Chamber</h2>
										<p>2017-2018</p>

									<p>The first-ever research project I worked on was also in Dr. Saffman's lab
										at UW - Madison, but was dedicated to a specific experiment. Particularly,
										I designed and implemented a high-precision temperature control system
										for our new Rubidium atomic trapping chamber. But first, what is an atomic trapping
										chamber and why is temperature regulation important? In order to build a quantum computer
										using neutral atoms, ensembles of neutral atoms must be encoded and trapped (via laser cooling)
										in
										special excited states known as W-sates. Maintaining this array of neutral atom quantum bits or qubits
										results in an optical lattice that can serve as the basis for a quantum computer. 
										If reliably trapped, one can perform quantum logic operations by
										exciting the atoms to a high-lying (n~100) so-called Rydberg state where they
										can undergo coherent interactions. However, great care must be taken to mitigate
										the rate of logical errors (i.e., incorrect atomic states) for this trap to hold.
										Theoretically, the potential fidelity (error rate) 
										for two-qubit entanglement via Rydberg interactions exceeds >0.9999, but previous
										attempts by any laboratory
										have only reached 0.8. Maximizing the fidelity of the initial W-state preparation
										is possible by either reducing system noise, minimizing polarization crosstalk 
										(i.e., polarization drift, see above project), or otherwise
									improving the stability of atomic cooling in the trap.</p>
									<p>My work for this project addressed the first of these points, for which I
										was charged with creating a temperature regulation system for our group's newest
										atomic trap. The environmental perturbations caused by large temperature fluctuations
										(>1<span>&#176;</span>C)
										throughout the previous fiberoptic system essentially made our
										optically trapped
										atoms moving targets. Therefore, I first developed a see-through prototype of a
										temperature-stable chamber which involved three ultra low-noise water-cooled fans
										(seen in the picture on the top right). Proof-of-concept tests with this prototype
										showed promise, so I drafted a full plan for a negative feedback PID temperature loop.
									I ordered the appropriate electronics (PID controller, fuses, heat sink, temperature probes, etc.) and machined an
									electronics box I designed on SolidWorks. After careful assembly, I ran another set of preliminary
									tests with the system to optimize the set-up, and integrated real-time temperature readout and control
									via lab computers. Finally, I installed the temperature regulation system into the new
									atomic chamber. The system is capable of consistently maintaining ~mK-level stability 
									within the chamber, far exceeding initial requirements and expectations and representing
									an improvement of over two orders of mangitude relative to the previous ambient trap. The
									lab still uses this system to this day for Rubidium experiments.</p>
