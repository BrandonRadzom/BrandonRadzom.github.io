							<h2>Outreach</h2>
						</header> -->
						
						<p>Public outreach is crucial to realize the broader impacts of research. I
						have long been invested in scientific outreach, and have participated in countless events
						targeting all ages and backgrounds in the local communities I've been a part of 
						throughout my academic career (see my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> for an exhaustive list).</p>

						</div>
						
						<p>More recently, I've been particularly excited about <em>Astronomy on Tap</em>,
						giving two talks to help launch a new Chapter in Bloomington, Indiana:
						one on NASA's DART mission and the other on the realism of exoplanets as 
						they are portrayed in the media. In 2022, I also created a Python workshop series (dubbed "PyIU") that recently
						expanded to accomodate IU students from all disciplines, and I am currently working
						with local organizations to bring programming and astronomy education to the greater sourthern 
						Indiana community and youth (see below for more details).</p>

						<p>In fall of 2022, I organized the first-ever Python Crash Course session for astronomy undergraduates
						at Indiana University (IU). This single event blossomed into the recurring PyIU Python workshop series,
						which serves to spark interest in STEM and provide students with
						the programming skills necessary to begin and ultimately succeed in scientific research. PyIU
						consists of two in-person Python sessions, which are free and offered once each every semester.
						The first is a lecture-style Python Crash Course designed to cover the fundamentals of Python
						and programming, including variables, lists, logic, loops, functions, and plotting. The second
						session, usually held later in the semester, is an Advanced Python Workshop that covers more
						powerful Python tools, tricks, packages, and practical applications in research (past topics include
						Data Analysis with numpy & pandas, Data Fitting, Statistics, Advanced Plotting, and much more). Both
						sessions are entirely led by IU Astronomy graduate students and postdocs.</p>

						</div>
						<p>Since 2022, many original resources and code demos have been produced through PyIU,
						which is why we have transitioned to making all materials available in a public
						GitHub repository, which is accessible here:
