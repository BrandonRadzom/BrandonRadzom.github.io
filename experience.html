							<h2>Service</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Service is integral to astronomy. Throughout
						my tenure in graduate school, I've had the opportunity to take on various scientific
						organization and leadership roles including Coordinator for
						Research Group Meetings and Exoplanet Journal Clubs, as well as elected positions
						within the Graduate Student Government such as Undergraduate Research Coordinator and
						Tea Talk Coordinator. I also served on the Science Organizing Committee (SOC) and
						Local Organizing Committee (LOC) for the 2022 Great Lakes Exoplanet Area Meeting
						(<a href="https://astro.indiana.edu/news-events/events/gleam-2023/index.html">GLEAM</a>)
						hosted at Indiana University (IU), and on the Mission & Vision Committee for the Emerging
						Researchers in Exoplanet Science (<a href="https://eres-planets.github.io/">ERES</a>) where I worked in a small, multi-institutional team to develop
						mission and vision statements for the annual ERES conference. We are publishing a whitepaper outlining
						our process for crafting these statements in the Bulletin of AAS (spring 2025), including findings
						from surveys we conducted and focus groups we held.</p>
						<header class="style1">
							<h2>Outreach</h2>
						</header>
						
						<p>Public outreach is crucial to realize the broader impacts of research. I
						have long been invested in scientific outreach, and have participated in countless events
						targeting all ages and backgrounds in the local communities I've been a part of 
						throughout my academic career (see my <a href="cv.html">CV</a> for an exhaustive list).</p>

						</div>
						
						<p>More recently, I've been particularly excited about <em>Astronomy on Tap</em>,
						giving two talks to help launch a new Chapter in Bloomington, Indiana:
						one on NASA's DART mission and the other on the realism of exoplanets as 
						they are portrayed in the media. In 2022, I also created a Python workshop series (dubbed "PyIU") that recently
						expanded to accomodate IU students from all disciplines, and I am currently working
						with local organizations to bring programming and astronomy education to the greater sourthern 
						Indiana community and youth (see below for more details).</p>

									<p>In fall of 2022, I organized the first-ever Python Crash Course session for astronomy undergraduates
									at Indiana University (IU). This single event blossomed into the recurring PyIU Python workshop series,
									which serves to spark interest in STEM and provide students with
									the programming skills necessary to begin and ultimately succeed in scientific research. PyIU
									consists of two in-person Python sessions, which are free and offered once each every semester.
									The first is a lecture-style Python Crash Course designed to cover the fundamentals of Python
									and programming, including variables, lists, logic, loops, functions, and plotting. The second
									session, usually held later in the semester, is an Advanced Python Workshop that covers more
									powerful Python tools, tricks, packages, and practical applications in research (past topics include
									Data Analysis with numpy & pandas, Data Fitting, Statistics, Advanced Plotting, and much more). Both
									sessions are entirely led by IU Astronomy graduate students and postdocs.</p>

									<p>Since 2022, many original resources and code demos have been produced through PyIU,
									which is why we have transitioned to making all materials available in a public
									GitHub repository, which is accessible here:

									<h2>NASA Planetary Science Summer School 
									(<a href=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/internships/apply/nasa-science-mission-design-schools/>PSSS</a>)</h2>
									<p>Summer 2023</p>
								</header>
									<p>I have a strong interest in mission science and support, and was fortunate
									to be selected for NASA's 2023 PSSS cohort. During this 11-week mission design training
									program, I joined a group of 18 graduate students and post-docs across various
									disciplines to develop a New-Frontiers (NF) class mission in response to the NF5
									Announcement of Opportunity (AO). After familiarizing ourselves with the AO and the 2023
									Planetary Science Decadal Survey, our team selected the enigmatic moon of Saturn, Titan, 
									as the target for our orbiter. We received 10 weeks of remote training
									on mission formulation from NASA mentors and were simultaneously tasked with
									developing our concept, which included consultations with NASA's Team-X along the
									way. I became engrossed in the science case for our mission, which was titled Titan's Hydrocarbons:
									Uncovering New Dimensions of Evolutionary pRocesses (THUNDER), and I assumed the role of
									Science Objective Lead for one of its three science objectives.</p>
										
									<p>During the culminating week  of the program, I also took on the role of Deputy PI and
									Science Subsystem Chair and worked alongside my cohort with NASA's Team-X 
									in person at JPL to complete a Point Design Study for THUNDER and finalize the concept (for Phase A review). 
									At the end of the week, our team underwernt a mock Portfolio Gate Review and presented
									THUNDER's design to a panel of NASA engineers, scientists, and executives.
									After completion of PSSS, my cohort and I wrote up our design in a manuscript
									that was recently accepted for publication in the Planetary Science Journal, hoping 
									that some of its concepts may be useful for future mission designs and may fuel 
									much-deserved scientific interest in Titan.</p>
