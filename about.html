										<h2>My Formation History</h2>
										<!--<p>Tempus feugiat veroeros sed nullam dolore</p>-->
									</header>
									<p>I grew up in the Twin Cities metro area in Minnesota, where I fell in love with 
									the night sky, hiking, cross-country skiing, and especially, long-distance running. For my undergraduate
									education, I attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison (go Badgers!), which gave me 
										the opportunity to grow my running hobby and also earn a degree in Astrophysics (best of both worlds!).
										About mid-way through my degree, I transitioned from Club running to half and full marathons. I also
										started going on a lot of trips to National Parks (hoping to visit them all some day?).
									</p>
									<p>After graduating, I extended my tenure in the midwest by moving to Bloomington, Indiana
									to pursue a PhD in Astronomy. After being limited to a virtual race experience for the 2020
									Boston marathon, I finally re-qualified and ran the 2025 Boston marathon - in Boston (and it was 
										a blast)! The somewhat warmer climate of southern Indiana left me itching for a winter activity,
									so I also picked up climbing and recreational league ultimate frisbee. If you're ever in the Bloomington area,
									and need some running recommendations (or a running pal!), feel free to reach out!</p>
									<p>Most importantly, I adopted a very silly but sweet orange cat named Kylo in 2024 (yes, I would like
										to see pictures of your cat as well).</p>
